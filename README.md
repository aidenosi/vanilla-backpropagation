# vanilla-backpropagation
Python implementation of a neural network using vanilla backpropagation. Includes options for activation function (sigmoid or tanh) and validation method (k-fold cross validation or holdout validation).

Parameters are set either explicitly in the code (lines 247-255) or through user input (needs to be uncommented). 

The function used to load the data is written particularly for the data in the accompanying folder, but can easily be fit to any data in a .csv format where the classification is the last entry for each line in the dataset.
